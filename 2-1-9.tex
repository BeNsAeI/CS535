- Deep learning is here to solve the problem that ML does not provide feaqtures


Deep learning:
- It will come up with the features automatically
- ML + feature extraction
- it is ML on several different levels

Handwriting problem:
- MNIST DB
 - 60 k training examples
 - 10k tests
 - in 90s

Bit of history:
- Perceptron was first NN ever introduced in a CS context
 - We needed a continuous version of sign function $\rightarrow$ Sigmoid
 - Sigmoid convers $-\infty$ to $\infty$
 - update: $\epsilon * x_i$
 - Linear classifiers can't solve XOR problem
 - Perceptron became dorment for another 10 years
- Expert systems and rule based systems $\rightarrow$ Deep rules
- Non linear ndural nets
 - input layer, hidden layers, output layer
 - each layer is activation on top of a linear combination of input
 - now we can solve XOR problem
 - Universal approximators
 - poor efficiency and performance optimization
 - issues with back propegation:
  - over fitting
  - slow
  - difficult to track
- Kernel methods
 - Fix basis functions
 - Proven to do the same thing as a single layer neural net
 - mor efficient and faster
 - learning a linear function leads to a non linear classifier!
 - It was called Support Vector Networks (SVN) just to get published
 - Issue: finding the right kernels
- Stocastic gradient decent
 - compute gradient on a smaller subset of the data
