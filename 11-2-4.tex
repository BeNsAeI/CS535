- Convolutional layers maintain image feature and preserve a lot of information
- Task of convolutional layers are to come up with features

Masking optimization: 
- $I_0$ is the image 
- $M is the mask$ 
- $f_c(x)$ is the deep network: 
\[argmin_M F_c(i_0,M) = f_c(\Phi(I_0,M)) + g(M))\]

Deconvolution and un-pooling:
- For max-pooling re-construction we do un-pooling

U-Net:
- Add linkage between  conv and ddeconv layers with same resolution
- improves spacial precision and helps at boundries
