- Multi-label/class classification problem:
 - multiple objects might exist in image

Neural Networks:
- Extrememly high dimentional
- High hidden layers
- High number of parameters (millions)

* Sobel filter
- 2 Convolutions:
 - Gx
 - Gy
 - Output : $max(G_x(I(x,y)),G_y(I(x,y)))$
- This is very easy to train!
- 1 image can turn into thousands of training sets

CNN:
- many filters
- each filter learns different things
