VGG network:
- Conv, conv, pool
- FC, FC, FC
- Softmax

Max pooling:
- Max pooling of 2, reduces the size of the image by half
- size of pooling stride dictates the length of resulting image.
- it actually has less chance of promoting noise than original image (there is a chance that the maximum is noise, but if noise is uniformly low, the probability of having noise does not change)
- Non smooth function and it has no gradient
- it is pointwise max and convex, it has sub-gradient
- 

- Max pooling generally has a very small edge (about 1\% or so better)
